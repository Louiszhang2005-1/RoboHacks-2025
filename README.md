**Winner of Unexpected Expedition Award, 5th place finisher overall**

• Developed an autonomous robot using C++ (Arduino Framework) integrating IR and color sensors for
real-time navigation, obstacle avoidance, and precise seed deployment.
• Designed and optimized a microcontroller-based system with servo motors and rechargeable
batteries, ensuring energy efficiency, sustainability, and reliable performance under competition
constraints.
• Designed and built a line-following seed-planting robot using Arduino, capable of planting 2 seeds in designated zones while
skipping areas based on color detection.
